This a CSS file. We are developing a responsive framework where our developers will have easy development with web design. We found standard CSS frameworks not suitable for our development with loading time or with first page interaction time. 
In this file there is basic CSS plus responsive media for devices we think are important in today's world.
We doubt grid system Col-1 Col2 will ease our development.
Where we are looking for developers front-end to write the code with any responsive code but using CSS file will be responsive without too many classes or declarations. 
Anyone can customise a styling sheet or CSS file without changing the code so better responsive will be achieved.  
We understand through @media our objective can be achieved but writing full code within the @media block is technical and time-consuming. 
We keep @media as a break-point for development. 
But by bringing a grid system with @media we believe we can simplify the development. Making grid width change to adopting to device width. 
Whereas with cache loading time father and memory consumption much lower. 
This Version 1 is still in the process of our achievement.
