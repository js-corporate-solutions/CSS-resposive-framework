This a CSS file. We are developing resposive framework where our developers wil have easy develpment with web design. We found standard CSS frameworks not suitable for our development with loading time or with first page ineration time. 
In this file there is basic CSS plus responsive media for devices we think important todays world.
We doubt grid system Col-1 Col2 will easy our developmet.
Where we are looking developers front-end to write the code with any resposive code but using CSS file will be responsive without too much classes or declrations. 
Anyone can customise styling sheet or CSS file without changing the code so better resposive will be achived.  
We undersand through @media our objctive can be achived but writing full code within @media block technical and time consuming. 
We keep @media as break-point for development. 
But bringing grid system with @media we belive we can simplefy the development. Making grid width change to adopting to device width. 
This verson 1 still on process of our achiement.
